# Introduction

Depression is a common mental disorder in the United States, with over 21 million adults reporting at least one major depressive episode in 2020[1]. Traditionally, epidemiological data for depression was collected through surveys. However, there are some disadvantages of survey-based methods, such as low response rates, the stigma of depression, concealment, report bias, and high costs[2]. Major organizations such as the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Anxiety & Depression Association of America (ADAA), and CDC provide only limited data specific to the time and population being studied from their surveys[3].

Google Trends is a free online tool that allows users to obtain big data on the search volume of different queries across various regions over time. The usefulness of internet search trends in the surveillance of mental health has been demonstrated. In 2019, Barros et al. utilized Google Trends search volumes for the prediction of national suicide rates in Ireland[4]; in 2021, Zhang et al. developed an effective method to monitor depression trends on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic[5]; in 2022, Wang et al. mapped depression prevalence in the United States using big data from Google Trends[3].

The overall goal of this project is to visualize the search volumes of depression-related words on Google and explore the factors that may impact the search. More specifically, we aim to:

  * Exploring how natural factors like air quality and socioeconomic factors like employment and income affect population depression in the US;
  
  * Making a prediction about depression-related indices based on these factors;
  
  * Building an interactive visualization interface to show the prevalence of depression across time and region;

# Data collection

Since there is no established database including data we need, we had to collect data from different sources and build up our own database first.

## Search volumes of depression-related words

Weekly data on the mental health session were extracted from Google Trends for an 18-year period (2004/01/01-2022/11/01) and separated by US state for the following terms: “feeling sad,” “depressed,” “depression,” “empty,” “insomnia,” “fatigue,” “guilty,” and “suicide.” Since Google Trends only provide search volume relative to the highest point for the given region and time, we have to download the absolute search volumes using [GLIMPSE](https://meetglimpse.com/extension/) in order to compare search volumes between different time periods and states. Due to the limitation of GLIMPSE, we only get absolute and relative search volumes for the recent five years (2017/11/01-2022/11/01). Then, data of relative search volumes for the rest of the years (2004-2017) was downloaded by using the ["gtrendsR"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtrendsR/gtrendsR.pdf) package. In order to get weekly data, we had to download the data every five years; and then, to make sure that the relative search volumes in different periods of time are comparable, we make sure that every two subsets of five years have at least one year of overlap. Linear regression models through the origin were adopted to: first, normalize the relative search volumes in different periods based on the overlapping year; and then, transform the relative search volumes to absolute search volumes.

## Environmental data

 * Data of local weather was downloaded from [VisualCrossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api). The dataset includes daily data of the average temperature, feels like temperature, precipitation volume, precipitation type and solar radiation of each state. 
 
 * Data of local air quality was downloaded by using [RAQSAPI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RAQSAPI/vignettes/RAQSAPIvignette.html) package from EPA. The dataset includes daily air quality index (AQI) of each state.

## Socioeconomic data

 * Monthly data of unemployment rates (2009-2022) by state was obtained from the website of National Conference of State Legislatures [NCSL](https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-unemployment-update.aspx).
 
 * Annually data of per capita personal income (2004-2021) by state was obtained from the website of Federal Reserve Economic Data [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=257197&rid=110).

* Median age by state was obtained from the website of [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/median-age-by-state).

* Data of education level by state was obtained from the website of U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA](https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17829). The dataset includes the percentage of the population in each state that fit in the following three education levels: not completing high school, completing high school only, and completing college.

# Shiny app: *Population Depression Data from Google Trends*

We built a Shiny app named *Population Depression Data from Google Trends* to visualize our data and prediction results. It can be accessed via [`https://conchaespina.shinyapps.io/FinalProject625/`](https://conchaespina.shinyapps.io/FinalProject625/). The app is composed of a side bar serving as a dashboard and a main panel to display plots. Its default interface is shown in Figure 1.

```{r, fig.cap="Default interface"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/GitHub/Final-project/report_figures/default.png")
```

There are two plot types available to choose. If selecting "Interest over time", a line graph tracing temporal change of absolute Google Trends search volume of given keyword, time range, and region will appear in the main panel. When time range includes a future date, predicted search volumes will be plotted in a dotted line following historical trend drawn in a solid line (Figure 2). If switching to "Interest by region", a US map will be displayed whose filled color indicates the total search volume within specified time period across all the states. The menu in section "Other indicators" allows users to choose an external indicator like unemployment rate or sunlight index to compare it with search volume (Figure 3). Values of this indicator will be printed as a text label at each state. If there is no label after selecting a certain indicator, it means data are not available for the current time range. Besides, both line graph and map are rendered by `plotly` and thus are interactive. Users can zoom in or check hover texts by moving cursor.

```{r, fig.cap='Line graph: Absolute search volume of keyword "Depression" between 1/1/22 and 2/28/23 in Michigan'}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/GitHub/Final-project/report_figures/line.png")
```

```{r, fig.cap='Map: Absolute search volume of keyword "Fatigue" between 1/1/20 and 10/31/22 with median age of each state'}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/GitHub/Final-project/report_figures/map.png")
```
